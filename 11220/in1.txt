First I give money to Teresa 
after I inform dad of 
your horrible soup

In this section we introduce the Algorithm in detail 
for ease of understanding our algorithm
Then we give the definition of the problem

The experimental results illustrate that our algorithm is fast
The set find-union may be used to improve the time complexity
The bit-parallel algorithm is utilized efficiently in other variants
It may speed up our algorithm or previously published algorithms with the bit-parallel algorithms

The paper studies how to improve the trading decision of Taiwan stocks with the information of US stock market
Our method first aligns the trading days between Taiwan and US stock markets
Next the similarity between the portfolio index constructed from Taiwan stocks and one of the US stock indices
Finally the consensus signals of PI are determined by the majority vote scheme with the weighted functions calculated from the similarity
